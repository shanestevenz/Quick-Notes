# Final Project
Shane Stevens (smstevens@wpi.edu), Reagan Brunelle (rmbrunelle2@wpi.edu), Siddhartha Pradhan (sppradhan@wpi.edu)

We will be creating a sticky notes web app, where users may create notes and choose different colors for those notes. Additionally, we plan on adding functionality that allows users to collaborate with different users through a sharable link. Notes can be assigned a particular 'tag' or category, which can be used to filter results. Additionay, there will be a grid view mode, and free board mode where users can drag the sticky notes any where on the screen to self organize.

## Backend
We will be using node.js along with express to create our server. MongoDB along with Mongoose will be used to handle data loading and saving to allow for persistent usage. We will include Local authentication and support for SSO (Google/github etc), and use sessions to allow users to stay logged in if they refresh)

## Frontend
For the Front end we will use React, along with tailwind css framework for styling.
